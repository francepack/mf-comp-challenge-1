# Static Comp Challenge 1
This website was my second project for Turing School. We were given a comp to replicate (with creative license) and asked to draw upon everthing we have learned thus far about HTML and CSS. I utilized flex-box in CSS, but we were instructed to not use grid. As we were given stylistic liberty, I chose to make a website that displays the main rotation for the Denver Nuggets.

### What I gained from this project
This assignment helped solidify my knowledge of implementing CSS rules for positioning items within boxes, and got me to experiment with different strategies to do this. Also, I learned about making a responsive site, implementing some media queries and using percentages in my widths to cover the screen for whatever device may pull up this page.
